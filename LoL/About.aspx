    <p>
    The game starts in "The Champion Select" where 5 players on each team choose their characters called "champions".
    Each champion has 4 different skills and a passive skill and they all have different stats.
    When the game loads you are Welcome to The Summoner's Rifft and the game starts.
    The map is divided to 3 lanes and a jungle between them.
    the point of this mode is to destroy the enemy turrets, get to the enemy's nexus which is the central building and destroy it.
    The team that destroyes the enemy's nexus wins the game.

    <h2>Twisted Treeline</h2>
    <center><img src="img/TwistedTreeLineicon.PNG" /></center>
    <p>
    In this mode like Summoner's Rift you start in champion select but instead of five characters in each team, each team selects 3 characters.
    The map has 2 lanes instead of 3 with a jungle between them.
    In the jungle there are two alters in each side.
    If you stand on the alter for a certain amount of time the alter locks and your team gets a buff.
    The buff stays on the team until the enemy teams takes the alter.
    The goal of this mode is to destroy the enemy nexus aswell.

    <h2>The Howling Abyss(ARAM)</h2>
    <center><img src="img/HowlingAbyssicon.PNG" /></center>
    <p>
    This mode also starts in champion select but this time it is different all the players get a champion randomly from their existing champion pool.
    This random aspect is interesting because then some players may get characters that they never played with and get to learn how they are played.
    This map doesn't have a jungle and has only one lane.
    In this mode you cant recall or shop for items unless you died or didnt pass the base radius.
    Because of the feature above ^ There are special health restoring points that appear so you can bring your health points up.

    <h2>The Crystal Scar</h2>
    <center><img src="img/crystalscaricon.PNG" /></center>
    <p>
    This mode is very different than the other ones.
    This mode is called dominion because each team starts with 500 points and for each point you control the enemy team loses a point every second.
    The point of this mode is to get your enemy team to 0 points.
    The map is a circle and there is a jungle in the middle the circle with a speed boost so you can get to the points quickly.
    This mode is 5 vs 5 aswell and the champion select screen is the same like the one in Summoners Rift and Twisted Treeline.
